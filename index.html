            <p>I studied Game Design in the United States on a scholarship, which gave me the opportunity to learn from renowned professors currently working on major games and films. With an intermediate level of English, I was able to communicate effectively and excel academically, earning awards for my high grades. I'm someone who easily understands new concepts and is always open to learning, which has helped me absorb and apply new knowledge efficiently. Currently, I'm continuing my Game Design studies in Brazil, where I'm expanding my skills in both 2D and 3D areas.</p>

            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>I had the opportunity to study Game Design in the United States through a scholarship, which represented a major milestone in my academic and professional career. During this time, I was able to learn from highly qualified professors, many of whom work directly on prominent projects in the gaming and film industries. This international experience not only broadened my vision of the market, but also required me to have good communication skills — even with an intermediate level of English, I was able to express myself clearly, actively participate in classes and excel in assessments, being recognized with awards for my academic performance.
                I am a curious, proactive person who is always willing to learn. These characteristics have been fundamental to my development, both in the academic environment and in the practical experiences I have been acquiring. I find it easy to understand new concepts and I enjoy putting them into practice in a creative and efficient way.
                I am currently continuing my studies in Game Design in Brazil, focusing on developing the 2D and 3D areas. This deepening has allowed me to explore new possibilities within game creation, expanding my technical and artistic repertoire, in addition to strengthening my base for increasingly complete and innovative projects.</p>

                    <p>Visual design developed in Photoshop with a focus on composition, contrast and visual impact. The character Akali is centered in a dynamic spotlight, with a vibrant red and black color palette that evokes her intense and lethal personality. The use of vertical Japanese typography on the left side adds a cultural and stylistic touch, while the name "AKALI" in large scale reinforces the visual identity. Graphic elements such as smoke, the neon dragon and the dark textured background were incorporated to convey the urban ninja theme, combining modern and traditional aesthetics.</p>

                    <p>Design developed in Autodesk Maya with a focus on aesthetic composition, product realism and visual impact. The SHEGLAM lipstick is presented in a studio layout with a dark background, highlighting the contrast between the matte material of the packaging and the metallic shine of the golden typography. The composition highlights the sophistication and modernity of the product, using strategic lighting to enhance the geometric shapes and premium finish.</p>
